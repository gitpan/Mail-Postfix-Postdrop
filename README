Mail-Postfix-Postdrop

Mail::Postfix::Postdrop implements parts of postfix's postdrop(1)
utility. Using the functionel interface you can inject messages directly
into the maildrop queu and using the OOish interface you can control parts
of the process.

The main use case is writing the mail to a queue where postfix will take
the responsability to deliver the mail without letting postfix handle the
mail immediately. This can be used for sending mails in transactions.
